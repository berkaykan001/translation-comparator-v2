## 📅 **Session 8** - October 21, 2025 ✅

**Phase 7: Settings Integration & UI Polish**

### **Issue Found:**
Settings were saving correctly but screens weren't reading them. All screens used hardcoded values instead of settings.

### **Major Fixes:**

**1. Settings Integration:**
- Fixed all screens to read from SettingsContext
- Language selection now properly affects translation tabs
- Native language used in all prompts
- Target languages (up to 4) shown as tabs in Translate mode

**2. Settings Architecture Redesign:**
- Changed from global AI model toggles to **per-mode AI model selection**
- Old: Single list of enabled models + separate output count per mode
- New: Each mode (translate/grammar/usage) has its own 1-5 selected models
- More intuitive: number of models selected = number of output windows

**3. Settings Migration:**
- Added automatic migration from old to new settings format
- Preserves user's previously enabled models
- Migrates both AsyncStorage and Firestore settings
- Fallback to defaults if anything goes wrong

**4. UI Improvements:**
- Fixed language tabs overflow (horizontal ScrollView)
- Centered tabs when fewer than 4 languages selected
- Compact display for Target Languages (shows count for 3+ languages)
- Consistent UI pattern for all selection modals

**Files Modified:**
- `src/contexts/SettingsContext.js` - New structure + migration logic
- `src/screens/SettingsScreen.js` - Redesigned AI Models section
- `src/screens/TranslateScreen.js` - Uses settings, centered tabs
- `src/screens/GrammarScreen.js` - Uses settings per mode
- `src/screens/UsageScreen.js` - Uses settings per mode
- `src/components/ThemedComponents.js` - Added centered tab styles

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Settings changes reflect immediately in all screens
- ✅ Cleaner, more compact Settings UI
- ✅ Per-mode customization (different models for different tasks)
- ✅ No text overflow in language tabs
- ✅ Seamless migration for existing users

---

**Status:** Phase 7 In Progress - Settings Integration Complete

## 🔄 **Next Session:**
- Continue Phase 7: Full testing, performance optimization, bug fixes
- Or build APK to test monetization features
